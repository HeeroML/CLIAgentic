# Mosh Feasibility Notes

Current app ships SSH only.

Why Mosh is deferred:
- `mosh` upstream is GPL-3.0 licensed.
- Integrating GPL components into an APK requires explicit legal/compliance review and licensing notices.
- Additional Android-specific networking/background behavior would need dedicated validation.
